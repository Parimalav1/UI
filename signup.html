    <h1> What do we do at Replate</h1>
    <p>Each and every restaurant meal produces half a pound of food waste. All that adds up to 11.4 million tons—and $25 billion—of food waste each year just from U.S. restaurants, says a recent report by the nonprofit ReFED. So what do restaurants do with leftover food? 
      We give the leftover food to people in need of it, to homeless shelters, orphanages, senior homes etc.</p>
